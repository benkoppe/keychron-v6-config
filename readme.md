# keychron-v6-config

This is my personal QMK configuration for the Keychron V6 keyboard. It is forked from the official Keychron V6 repository -- the original readme contents can be seen below.

This configuration is designed with VIAL in mind. Right now, the only modification made is to enable all RGB modes, as well as custom matrix effects for VIAL.
